### Basic Command for initializing and pushing a Git repository to a remote

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
    git push -u origin main

<br><br>

1. **`git init`** – Initializes a new Git repository by creating a `.git` folder.  <br>
2. **`git add .`** – Stages all changes in the current directory for commit. <br>
3. **`git commit -m "first commit"`** – Saves the staged changes with a message. We can change the message to anything to describe the changes, like: git commit -m "Added login functionality" <br>
4. **`git branch -M main`** – Renames the current branch to `main`. Initially, Git used master as the default branch name. However, newer versions of Git (since 2020) default to main instead of master. If your Git still defaults to master, the command renames it to main. <br>
5. **`git remote add origin <URL>`** – Links the local repo to a remote GitHub repository. <br>
6. **`git push -u origin main`** – Pushes the `main` branch to the remote repo and sets tracking. <br>

### rm -rf .git

Running git init creates a .git folder, which makes a directory a Git repository by storing all version control data, including commits, branches, and settings. <br>
We use rm -rf .git to completely delete the Git history and configuration from a project, making it no longer a Git repository.

You should run `rm -rf .git` when:  

1. **Wrong Repository Initialization:** If you accidentally initialized Git in the wrong directory.  
2. **Corrupted Git Repository:** When the repository is broken or behaving unexpectedly.  
3. **Starting Fresh:** If you want to remove all version history and start tracking from scratch.  
4. **Before Cloning:** If you manually copied a project instead of cloning it and want to set up Git properly.  

Avoid using it unless absolutely necessary, as it permanently deletes all Git history.

The full form of rm -rf .git is:

rm – Remove (deletes files or directories).
-r – Recursive (deletes directories and their contents).
-f – Force (deletes without confirmation, even if write-protected).
.git – The hidden folder that stores Git repository data.
This command forcefully and recursively deletes the .git folder, removing all version control history.
