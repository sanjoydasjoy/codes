For example, kernel as the engine of a car and the OS as the entire car, including the engine, body, seats, and controls. <br>
When we turn on the video player to play a movie, <br> 
the OS helps you open the video player, find the movie file, and run the app. The kernel makes sure the video player can use hardware like the GPU and speakers, and manages system resources (like memory and CPU) for everything to work smoothly. The OS is for user tasks, and the kernel handles the hardware. <br><br>
