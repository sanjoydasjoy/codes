**Divisibility rules** for numbers **2 through 9** with examples:

---

1. **Divisible by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if it ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).  
   **Example**: 124 is divisible by 2 because it ends in 4 (an even digit).  

---

2. **Divisible by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.  
   **Example**: 123 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and 6 is a multiple of 3.  

---

3. **Divisible by 4**: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.  
   **Example**: 1,024 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits, 24, are divisible by 4.  

---

4. **Divisible by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.  
   **Example**: 1,235 is divisible by 5 because it ends in 5.  

---

5. **Divisible by 6**: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.  
   **Example**: 126 is divisible by 6 because:  
   - It ends in 6 (divisible by 2).  
   - The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 (divisible by 3).  

---

6. **Divisible by 7**: To check divisibility by 7:  
   - Double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number.  
   - If the result is divisible by 7 (including 0), the original number is divisible by 7.  
   **Example**: 161 is divisible by 7 because:  
   - 16 - (2 Ã— 1) = 14, and 14 is divisible by 7.  

---

7. **Divisible by 8**: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.  
   **Example**: 2,416 is divisible by 8 because its last three digits, 416, are divisible by 8.  

---

8. **Divisible by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   **Example**: 1,458 is divisible by 9 because 1 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 18, and 18 is a multiple of 9.  

---

9. **Divisible by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.  
10. **Divisible by 11**: Subtract the sum of the digits in odd positions from the sum of the digits in even positions. If the result is divisible by 11 (including 0), the number is divisible by 11.  
11. **Divisible by 12**: A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  
12. **Divisible by 13**: No simple rule; use division.  
13. **Divisible by 14**: A number is divisible by 14 if it is divisible by both 2 and 7.  
14. **Divisible by 15**: A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.  
15. **Divisible by 16**: A number is divisible by 16 if its last four digits form a number divisible by 16.  
16. **Divisible by 17**: No simple rule; use division.  
17. **Divisible by 18**: A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  
18. **Divisible by 19**: No simple rule; use division.  

For numbers like 13, 17, and 19, there are no widely used simple rules, so division is often the easiest method.
