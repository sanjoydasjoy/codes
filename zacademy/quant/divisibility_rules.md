**Divisibility rules** for numbers **2 through 9** with examples:

---

❏ **Divisible by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if it ends in an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).  
   **Example**: 124 is divisible by 2 because it ends in 4 (an even digit).  

---

❏ **Divisible by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.  
   **Example**: 123 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and 6 is a multiple of 3.  

---

❏ **Divisible by 4**: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.  
   **Example**: 1,024 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits, 24, are divisible by 4.  

---

❏ **Divisible by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.  
   **Example**: 1,235 is divisible by 5 because it ends in 5.  

---

❏ **Divisible by 6**: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.  
   **Example**: 126 is divisible by 6 because:  
   - It ends in 6 (divisible by 2).  
   - The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 (divisible by 3).  

---

❏ **Divisible by 7**: To check divisibility by 7:  
   - Double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number.  
   - If the result is divisible by 7 (including 0), the original number is divisible by 7.  
   **Example**: 161 is divisible by 7 because:  
   - 16 - (2 × 1) = 14, and 14 is divisible by 7.  

---

❏ **Divisible by 8**: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number divisible by 8.  
   **Example**: 2,416 is divisible by 8 because its last three digits, 416, are divisible by 8.  

---

❏ **Divisible by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   **Example**: 1,458 is divisible by 9 because 1 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 18, and 18 is a multiple of 9.  

---

❏ **Divisible by 10**: A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.  
❏ **Divisible by 11**: No simple rule; use division. 
❏ **Divisible by 12**: A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  
❏ **Divisible by 13**: No simple rule; use division.  
❏ **Divisible by 14**: A number is divisible by 14 if it is divisible by both 2 and 7.  
❏ **Divisible by 15**: A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.  
❏ **Divisible by 16**: A number is divisible by 16 if its last four digits form a number divisible by 16.  
❏ **Divisible by 17**: No simple rule; use division.  
❏ **Divisible by 18**: A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  
❏ **Divisible by 19**: No simple rule; use division.
