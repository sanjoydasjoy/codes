According to TCP/IP
theres 5 layers

application layer -> transport layer -> network layer -> data link layer -> physical layer 


Data Journey Recap:
My email (application data) is passed down from the Application Layer to the Transport Layer (TCP), where it is broken into segments.
These segments are passed to the Network Layer (IP), where they are addressed and routed.
The Data Link Layer formats them to frames for transmission on a local network (ie Ethernet/WiFi).
Finally, the Physical Layer sends the bits through physical media, like cables or Wi-Fi signals.

Once it reaches the destination, the process is reversed, and the email is reconstructed on the receiving device, eventually reaching the email application.



According to OSI Model
theres 7 layers

application layer ->Presentation Layer-> transport layer -> network layer -> data link layer -> physical layer
