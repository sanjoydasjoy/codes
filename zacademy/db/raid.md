# Storage
In computer systems, physical storage can be classified based on volatility. <br><br>
## Classification by Volatility 

1. Volatile Storage:<br>
Definition: Storage that loses its data when the power is turned off.<br>
Examples: Primary memory (RAM) and cache memory.<br>
Usage: Often used for temporary data storage while programs are running due to its high speed but low persistence.<br>

2. Non-Volatile Storage:<br>
Definition: Storage that retains data even after power is turned off.<br>
Examples: HDDs, SSDs, Optical disks (CDs, DVDs), magnetic tapes.<br>
Usage: Ideal for long-term data storage due to data persistence.<br>

<br><br>
**Factors Affecting Choice of Storage Media** <br>
Speed: <br>
Faster Media: RAM, SSDs.<br>
Slower Media: HDDs, magnetic tapes (typically used for backups).<br>
<br>
Cost per Unit of Data:
<br>
High Cost: Faster media such as SSDs and RAM.<br>
Low Cost: Slower media like HDDs and magnetic tapes.<br><br>
Reliability:<br>
More Reliable: Non-volatile media, especially for long-term storage.<br>
Less Reliable: Volatile memory (RAM), which loses data if power is lost.<br>
