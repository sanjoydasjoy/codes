# Storage
In computer systems, physical storage can be classified based on volatility. <br><br>
## Classification by Volatility 
<br>
1. Volatile Storage:<br>
Definition: Storage that loses its data when the power is turned off.
Examples: Primary memory (RAM) and cache memory.
Usage: Often used for temporary data storage while programs are running due to its high speed but low persistence.
Non-Volatile Storage:

Definition: Storage that retains data even after power is turned off.
Examples:
Secondary Storage: Hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
Tertiary Storage: Optical disks (CDs, DVDs), magnetic tapes.
Battery-Backed Main Memory: RAM with battery backup for certain critical applications.
Usage: Ideal for long-term data storage due to data persistence.
Factors Affecting Choice of Storage Media
Speed: The time it takes to access data.

Faster Media: RAM, SSDs.
Slower Media: HDDs, magnetic tapes (typically used for backups).
Cost per Unit of Data:

High Cost: Faster media such as SSDs and RAM.
Low Cost: Slower media like HDDs and magnetic tapes.
Reliability:

More Reliable: Non-volatile media, especially for long-term storage.
Less Reliable: Volatile memory (RAM), which loses data if power is lost.
