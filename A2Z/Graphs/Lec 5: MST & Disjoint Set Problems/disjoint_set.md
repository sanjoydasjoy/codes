this is the most important topic in the graph series and commonly asked in almost all interview and online assessment as well. so you gotta master it. <br><br>
### Disjoint set
1. **Definition**: A disjoint set is a way to group items into separate groups where no group overlaps.
2. **Properties**:  
   - It has two main tasks:
   - 1. Find: Check which group an item belongs to.
   - 2. Union: Combine two groups into one.
   - Itâ€™s useful for solving problems like connecting things or finding if two things are in the same group.

3. **Better Understanding**:
   - suppose there is a graph with two separate components {1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7}
   - if it was asked that does 1 and 5 belong to the same component or not
   - what is brute force approach, we will pick up 1 and start dfs traversal, so since it couldnt find 5, means they dont belong to the same component
