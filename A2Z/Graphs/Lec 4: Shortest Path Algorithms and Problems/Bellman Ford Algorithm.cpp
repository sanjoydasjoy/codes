Here's a concise yet informative comparison of the **Bellman-Ford** algorithm and **Dijkstra's** algorithm:

### **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
1. **Purpose**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.  
2. **Edge Weights**: Works with graphs having **negative edge weights**.  
3. **Algorithm Type**: Relaxation-based; iterates through all edges multiple times.  
4. **Complexity**: \(O(V \cdot E)\), where \(V\) is vertices and \(E\) is edges.  
5. **Use Case**: Detects negative weight cycles (if present).  
6. **Updates**: Updates distance using all edges in every iteration.

### **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
1. **Purpose**: Also finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.  
2. **Edge Weights**: Assumes all edge weights are **non-negative**.  
3. **Algorithm Type**: Greedy; picks the shortest known distance at each step.  
4. **Complexity**: \(O((V + E) \log V)\) with a priority queue (binary heap).  
5. **Use Case**: Faster on dense graphs with non-negative weights.  
6. **Updates**: Uses a priority queue to update distances efficiently.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                | Bellman-Ford                   | Dijkstra                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Edge Weights**       | Handles negative weights       | Non-negative weights only   |
| **Cycle Detection**    | Detects negative weight cycles | Cannot detect cycles        |
| **Speed**              | Slower for large graphs        | Faster with a priority queue|
| **Approach**           | Dynamic programming            | Greedy algorithm            |

### **When to Use**
- **Bellman-Ford**: Use it when negative weights are possible or when you need to detect negative weight cycles.
- **Dijkstra**: Use it for non-negative edge weights where speed is critical.
