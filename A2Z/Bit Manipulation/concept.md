right shift: n >> k = n / (2^k)


largest int number (16 bit) = 0111 1111 1111 1111 <br>
               The value of this binary number is calculated as: <br>





  \[
  0111\,1111\,1111\,1111
  \]
  - Here, the MSB is \(0\) (indicating a positive number), and the remaining 15 bits are all \(1\).
- The value of this binary number is calculated as:
  \[
  2^{14} + 2^{13} + 2^{12} + \dots + 2^{0} = 2^{15} - 1
  \]
