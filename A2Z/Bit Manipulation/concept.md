right shift: n >> k = n / (2^k)


 - largest int number (16 bit) = 0111 1111 1111 1111 <br>
               The value of this binary number is calculated as: <br>

The value of this binary number is calculated as:  2^14 + 2^13 + 2^12 + ... + 2^0 = 2^(14+1) - 1 / (2 - 1) = 2^15 - 1 = 32767 = INT_MAX <br>
